# Histogram-Equalization

Each program takes a color image as input and produces a color
image as output. A program operates on a specific color space, and uses 1 out of 3 possible algorithms:
• Linear stretching
• OpenCV histogram equalization
• The histogram equalization algorithm described in class

Each program implements either linear scaling ir histogram equalization over the Luv, XYZ, and RGB colorspaces.
xyz_classhisteq and Luv_classhisteq both implement an algorithm for histogram equalization taught the Introduction to Computer vision course.
